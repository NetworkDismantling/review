    abstract={We elaborate on a linear-time implementation of Collective-Influence (CI) algorithm introduced by Morone, Makse, Nature 524, 65 (2015) to find the minimal set of influencers in networks via optimal percolation. The computational complexity of CI is O(N log N) when removing nodes one-by-one, made possible through an appropriate data structure to process CI. We introduce two Belief-Propagation (BP) variants of CI that consider global optimization via message-passing: CI propagation (CIP) and Collective-Immunization-Belief-Propagation algorithm (CIBP) based on optimal immunization. Both identify a slightly smaller fraction of influencers than CI and, remarkably, reproduce the exact analytical optimal percolation threshold obtained in Random Struct. Alg. 21, 397 (2002) for cubic random regular graphs, leaving little room for improvement for random graphs. However, the small augmented performance comes at the expense of increasing running time to O(N2), rendering BP prohibitive for modern-day big-data. For instance, for big-data social networks of 200 million users (e.g., Twitter users sending 500 million tweets/day), CI finds influencers in 2.5{\thinspace}hours on a single CPU, while all BP algorithms (CIP, CIBP and BDP) would take more than 3,000 years to accomplish the same task.},

In this work we introduce CoreGDM, a trainable algorithm for network dismantling via node-removal. The approach is based on Geometric Deep Learning and that merges the Graph Dismantling Machine (GDM) [19] framework with the CoreHD [40] algorithm, by attacking the 2-core of the network using a learnable score function in place of the degree-based one. Extensive experiments on fifteen real-world networks show that CoreGDM outperforms the original GDM formulation and the other state-of-the-art algorithms, while also being more computationally efficient.",

Recently these two closely related problems were tackled by several heuristic algorithms, simple and considerably sub-optimal, on the one hand, and involved and accurate message-passing ones that evaluate single-node marginal probabilities, on the other hand. In this paper we propose a simple and extremely fast algorithm, CoreHD, which recursively removes nodes of the highest degree from the 2-core of the network. CoreHD performs much better than all existing simple algorithms. When applied on real-world networks, it achieves equally good solutions as those obtained by the state-of-art iterative message-passing algorithms at greatly reduced computational cost, suggesting that CoreHD should be the algorithm of choice for many practical purposes.},

  abstract={Finding an optimal set of nodes, called key players, whose activation (or removal) would maximally enhance (or degrade) a certain network functionality, is a fundamental class of problems in network science. Potential applications include network immunization, epidemic control, drug design and viral marketing. Due to their general NP-hard nature, these problems typically cannot be solved by exact algorithms with polynomial time complexity. Many approximate and heuristic strategies have been proposed to deal with specific application scenarios. Yet, we still lack a unified framework to efficiently solve this class of problems. Here, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning framework FINDER, which can be trained purely on small synthetic networks generated by toy models and then applied to a wide spectrum of application scenarios. Extensive experiments under various problem settings demonstrate that FINDER significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of solution quality. Moreover, it is several orders of magnitude faster than existing methods for large networks. The presented framework opens up a new direction of using deep learning techniques to understand the organizing principle of complex networks, which enables us to design more robust networks against both attacks and failures.},

    abstract = {Finding an optimal subset of nodes in a network that is able to efficiently disrupt the functioning of a corrupt or criminal organization or contain an epidemic or the spread of misinformation is a highly relevant problem of network science. In this paper, we address the generalized network-dismantling problem, which aims at finding a set of nodes whose removal from the network results in the fragmentation of the network into subcritical network components at minimal overall cost. Compared with previous formulations, we allow the costs of node removals to take arbitrary nonnegative real values, which may depend on topological properties such as node centrality or on nontopological features such as the price or protection level of a node. Interestingly, we show that nonunit costs imply a significantly different dismantling strategy. To solve this optimization problem, we propose a method which is based on the spectral properties of a node-weighted Laplacian operator and combine it with a fine-tuning mechanism related to the weighted vertex cover problem. The proposed method is applicable to large-scale networks with millions of nodes. It outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and opens more directions for understanding the vulnerability and robustness of complex systems.}

Identifying the minimal set of units to attack to disintegrate a complex network, i.e. network dismantling, is a computationally challenging (NP-hard) problem which is usually attacked with heuristics. Here, we show that a machine trained to dismantle relatively small systems is able to identify higher-order topological patterns, allowing to disintegrate large-scale social, infrastructural and technological networks more efficiently than human-based heuristics. Remarkably, the machine assesses the probability that next attacks will disintegrate the system, providing a quantitative method to quantify systemic risk and detect early-warning signals of system's collapse. This demonstrates that machine-assisted analysis can be effectively used for policy and decision-making to better quantify the fragility of complex systems and their response to shocks.},

For a large class of random graphs, this problem is tightly connected to the decycling problem (the removal of vertices, leaving the graph acyclic). Exploiting this connection and recent works on epidemic spreading, we present precise predictions for the minimal size of a dismantling set in a large random graph with a prescribed (light-tailed) degree distribution. Building on the statistical mechanics perspective, we propose a three-stage Min-Sum algorithm for efficiently dismantling networks, including heavy-tailed ones for which the dismantling and decycling problems are not equivalent. We also provide additional insights into the dismantling problem, concluding that it is an intrinsically collective problem and that optimal dismantling sets cannot be viewed as a collection of individually well-performing nodes.}
