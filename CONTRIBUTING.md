## How to contribute to this project

This project is open source, and its meant to provide a common benchmark for the network dismantling algorithms.
We welcome contributions from the community.

If you want to contribute, please read this document first, the readme file, and the [Discussions](https://github.com/NetworkDismantling/review/discussions) section of the repository.

### Pull requests

We love pull requests, but please follow the guidelines below.

### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/NetworkDismantling/review/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/NetworkDismantling/review/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.


### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the Pull Request description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality or new methods will generally not be accepted.

### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* **Ensure no one else is working on the same thing** by searching on GitHub under [Discussions](https://github.com/NetworkDismantling/review/discussions) and [Pull Requests](https://github.com/NetworkDismantling/review/pulls).

* If you're unable to find a discussion and pull request for the feature, suggest it in the [Ideas section of the Discussions](https://github.com/NetworkDismantling/review/discussions/categories/ideas) before start writing code. This way you can get feedback from the community and the feature can be prioritized. Moreover, you can get some guidance on how to implement it.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.


### Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for usability, readability, modularity and performance (in that order).

  * We indent using four spaces (soft tabs)
  * We use named parameters for all methods that accept more than two parameters.
  * This is open source software meant for the community:
    * Use the terminology and the notation of the Network Science field.
    * Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. 
    * The code you write should be easy to understand. Do not sacrifice clarity for brevity.
    * Use comments to explain code that may be confusing to others.
    * Make sure your code is well tested.
    * Make functions or methods small and simple. Avoid monolithic functions or methods.
    * Reuse code whenever possible. Do not duplicate code. 
    * Prefer external libraries over writing your own code.
